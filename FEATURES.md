# Features:
- [IN PROGRESS] let injected html use features on library and make it so its connected with parent and not child that html is injected into
- allow to bind values in object (this.$.settings.password)
- create `this` variable in events and outputs so we can pass reference to the node
- allow injected html to be separate int different packages that can be used in few places\
- change name of files from `main` to name of component so debuging is easier
- [DONE] bind default attributes
- [DONE] have only one style tag
- [DONE] dynamic CSS variables?
- [DONE] Setting to allow use of local storage
- [DONE] Find a way how to figure out when local storage is overflowing and how to remove old templates
- [DONE] check if registrated component (which wasn't displayed at start) is properly downloaded
- [DONE] Check if binded value when passed as bind to the third component works as intended
- [DONE] changes in events and outputs should update actual value in observable
- [DONE] passing methods on change - (bind)
- [DONE] passing arguments - [bind]
- [DONE] Attributes
- [DONE] persistent storage
- [DONE] two way binding - ([bind])
- [DONE] if and for's
- [DONE] reusable templates
- [DONE] file separation
- [DONE] events and {{}}
- [DONE] passing html to the inside of element will result in rendering it inside of it
- [DONE] allow choosing where to put injected html
- [REMOVED] Event when first render finishes and every component is downloaded - not really doable with all those asyncs, and removing that creates pretty long waiting time
- [REMOVED] Add jmonkey-spinner class - if someone wants to have loaders they will add them
- [REMOVED] Add a way to send all templates for page in one file - can't put js modules in string and make it work with Function
- [REMOVED] Save JS in local storage and build it from Function - same reason as single file - can't put exports in string
- [REMOVED] pipes - not needed, we can actually use method
